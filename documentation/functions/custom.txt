DEFINING
Functions are defined using the "func" keyword with the following
structure:

func FUNCTIONNAME() {
	FUNCTION CONTENTS
}

FUNCTIONNAME is the name of the function.
FUNCTION CONTENTS is the contents of the function and must be inside the
two curly braces. It is best to include a return statement (return;) at 
the end of the function, but it is not required.

CALLING
Functions can be called anywhere in the program by calling the function
name followed by opening and closing brackets.
