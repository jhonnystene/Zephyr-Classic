CONDITIONAL PARSING

	do functionName() if ( condition )

1. Look at condition
	- Is there an equals sign?

			- If so, we need to have a jne statement
			- If not, we need to have a je statement
		
	- Is there a more than sign but not a less than sign?
		- If so, we need to have a ja statement
		
	- Is there a less than sign but not a more than sign? 
		- If so, we need to have a jb statement
		
	- Is there a less than AND a more than sign?
		- Is there an equals sign?
			- Error out
			
		- Is there not an equals sign?
			- If so, we need to have a jne statement

2. Do a comparison between C1 and C2
	- cmp C1, C2
	
3. Add in any needed conditionals
